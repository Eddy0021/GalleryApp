# GalleryApp

<h1>Few words about the project</h1>
<p>This app works as a website created with .net 6 Core and Vue.js (Vue 3 CLI), when you open the site you'll be redirected to the login page, where you can register or login
and as third option you can request a password reset, after login you can see all the folders that account had created earlier, by clicking on the folders we open them up
and we can see all the pictures which the user updated to that folder, by clicking on the image we view the image in a pop-up window</p>

<p>We can Create/Re-Name and Delete images</p>
<p>We can Create/Re-Name and Delete folders (NOTE: if you delete a folder, you'll delete all the images inside too)</p>
